# Polarity-Detection-in-Cross-Lingual-Sentiment-Analysis

TF-IDF features are extracted from three different N-grams (Unigrams, Bigrams and Trigrams) in the corpus after preprocessing to remove irrelevant details. These are then trained and tested using three machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

Results from this analysis were published in the proceedings of the 2020 8th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO): **M. Sharma, "Polarity Detection in a Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis using spaCy," 2020 8th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions) (ICRITO), Noida, India, 2020, pp. 490-496, doi: 10.1109/ICRITO48877.2020.9197829.**
